TODOS
----

1. classnames
2. find a good way to server-side render. output string/files/stream
3. attach only mounted components' styles to DOM
4. replace style objects with class names on server for the client
5. object/assign array styles
6. allow plugins like classnames for users
7. check server-side rendered styles when client react takes over DOM and only add what is needed
8. make sure not to (easily) pass 32 stylesheets for IE9
9. gulp + grunt plugin
